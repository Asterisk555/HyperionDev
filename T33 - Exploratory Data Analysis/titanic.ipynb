    "Children appear to have been let on first. A negative correlation coefficient between age and survival rate (-0.077221) suggests that as age increases, survival rate decreases. This could imply that younger people were more likely to survive, and therefore that they were offered spots on lifeboats first. But to be a \"child\" there would be an age cut-off, and I want to see if children overall had a preference rather than, for example, young adults surviving better because they're healthier. A law passed in 1855 that changed age of consent from 13 to 16, and the titanic sank in 1912, so I'm going to infer that anyone below 16 would have qualified as a child. Having created an age group for under 16s I found a positive correlation of 0.136106, which suggests that people under the age of 16 have a higher survival rate. It is worth noting, however, of 892 entries, 176 are missing data for age.\n",
